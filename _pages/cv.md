  ### Education
  <p><strong>South China Agricultural University (Guangzhou)</strong> <span style="float:right;">September 2023–Present</span><br>
  Agricultural Mechanical Engineering | Master of Engineering<br>
  GPA: 3.6</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Research Interests: Computer Vision (3D Modeling, Object Detection, Semantic Segmentation)</li>
    <li>Application: Using drone-acquired images, using semantic segmentation and 3D reconstruction from multi-view geometry, we modeled a sugarcane transporter in the field. We then combined the identified number of sugarcanes on the surface an the volume of the pile to estimate the impurity rate of the sugarcane.</li>
