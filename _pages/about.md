I am a third-year graduate student from  [the Engineering College of South China Agricultural University](https://gcxy.scau.edu.cn/main.htm). My research interests include computer vision and machine learning,and I have experience in finite element and discrete element simulations, as well as embedded systems.

I ranked fourth in my major upon admission, received two first-class scholarships, and was exempted from the English language test, among other honors.

I am extremely fortunate to be guided by Professor [Yang Dantong](https://gcxy.scau.edu.cn/2015/0318/c16514a348800/page.htm), who is from the the Engineering College

I submitted a patent titled "A Method for Measuring Impurity Rate in Sugarcane Piles Obtained by Mechanical Harvesting." In the process, I learned algorithms for object detection, semantic segmentation, and 3D modeling.

Although I haven't published a paper yet, please believe in my academic potential.
