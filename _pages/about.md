I am a third-year graduate student from  [the Engineering College of South China Agricultural University](https://gcxy.scau.edu.cn/main.htm). My research interests include computer vision and machine learning.and I have experience in finite element and discrete element simulations, as well as embedded systems.

I am extremely fortunate to be guided by Professor [Yang Dantong](https://gcxy.scau.edu.cn/2015/0318/c16514a348800/page.htm), who is from the the Engineering College

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

 You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!
